# IOLITE Multimodal Interaction Project

This Project is about developing an application and driver for the IOLITE Plattform. The project is based on a multi modal interation aproach. The app with be a SlackBot and the driver will make it possible to communicato over a bluetooth ring with the iolite box.

## Goals
The goal of the iolite app is to implement a chat bot that can answer questions about my smart home. In cases where the question is not specific enough the chat bot should ask the user actively about missing information. E.g,. “switch on the light in the living room”, ”which light?”
On the other side the the goal of the driver is to implement a gesture control of smart home appliances and services over the usage of rules using our ring-shaped interaction device called PeriSense.
